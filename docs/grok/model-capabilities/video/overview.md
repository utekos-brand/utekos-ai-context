#### Model Capabilities

# Video Overview

Grok Imagine video models turn a set of references, a still image, an existing clip, or a prompt into video with generated audio. `grok-imagine-video-1.5` generates lip-synced speech, renders text-to-video and image-to-video at native 1080p, takes up to 14 reference images and 3 voice references, and pins first, last, and mid-video frames, in clips up to 15 seconds. `grok-imagine-video-1.5-lite` does text-to-video and image-to-video with lip-synced speech at the lowest price per second, reaching 1080p by upscaling 720p. We recommend `grok-imagine-video-1.5-lite` for simple videos, and `grok-imagine-video-1.5` when you need references, voices, pinned frames, or native 1080p.

Requests are asynchronous: submit, poll with the returned `request_id`, then download the clip. The xAI SDK and the Vercel AI SDK poll for you ([how it works](/developers/model-capabilities/video/generation#how-it-works)).

## Reference-to-video

Reference images supply the characters, products, and locations without fixing the first frame: up to 14 per request on `grok-imagine-video-1.5`, 7 on `grok-imagine-video`. On `grok-imagine-video-1.5`, `reference_audios` gives up to three characters a preset voice, with lip-synced speech. Voice references from your own audio files are available to trusted partners [on request](https://x.ai/contact-sales?interest=imagine).

## First, key, and last frames

On `grok-imagine-video-1.5`, `image` sets the first frame, `last_frame` the last, and up to four `keyframes` pin frames at chosen timestamps; the model fills in the motion. Pass the same image as `image` and `last_frame` to make a loop.

## Image-to-video

The still you pass as `image` becomes the first frame, and the prompt describes what happens next. The output always matches the still's aspect ratio; `aspect_ratio` is ignored.

## Text-to-video

Describe the shot, including camera movement, lighting, and sound. On `grok-imagine-video-1.5` and `grok-imagine-video-1.5-lite`, the model renders a first frame from the prompt, then animates it.

## Video editing

Send a clip and an instruction to `grok-imagine-video`. It applies the change and keeps everything else as close to the source as it can; say what must stay the same, as these prompts do.
