# Services routing

Your `vercel.json` controls all public routing for the deployment. A service receives public traffic only when there is a top-level rewrite that routes requests to it. Each service then handles its own routes, and the routes of one service are never mixed with another, so every public routing rule has a single owner. For how services are defined and built, see [Services](/docs/services).

Where usual [rewrite rules](/docs/routing) target URLs, service rewrites target services instead. Set the `destination` value in a rewrite rule to an object like `{ "service": "my_backend" }`. For example:

vercel.json

```
{
  "services": {
    "my_frontend": {
      "root": "frontend/"
    },
    "my_backend": {
      "root": "backend/",
      "entrypoint": "main:app"
    }
  },
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/(.*)",
      "destination": { "service": "my_backend" }
    },
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": { "service": "my_frontend" }
    }
  ]
}
```

The destination object accepts the following fields:

| Field     | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `service` | Yes      | Name of a service in the same deployment, from your `services` configuration.                                                                                                       |
| `path`    | No       | The path used to select a route inside the service. It changes which route runs, not the path your code sees. See [Rules inside a service](#rules-inside-a-service) for an example. |

## How requests are routed

Vercel evaluates your top-level rewrites in order and routes each request to the first matching service. Using the configuration above, where `/api/(.*)` routes to `my_backend` and everything else routes to `my_frontend`:

| Request            | Handled by    | Service receives |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ---------------- |
| `GET /dashboard`   | `my_frontend` | `/dashboard`     |
| `GET /api/users`   | `my_backend`  | `/api/users`     |
| `POST /api/orders` | `my_backend`  | `/api/orders`    |

The service receives the original request path. `GET /api/users` reaches `my_backend` as `/api/users`, not `/users`.

Once a request is routed to a service, that service handles the rest of routing. If nothing inside the service matches, the service is expected to return its own 404 or 405 response.

Routing into a service is final. If no route matches inside the service, Vercel does not fall back to your other top-level rewrites. It returns the service's not-found response.

## Rules inside a service

A service can define its own `headers`, `redirects`, `rewrites`, and `routes`, using the same syntax as the [top-level configuration](/docs/project-configuration/vercel-json). These run only after a top-level rewrite routes a request into the service, and they can match on the state the rewrite passed in.

For example, capture an organization slug at the top level, pass it to the service as query state, and let the service add a response header based on it:

vercel.json

```
{
  "services": {
    "my_backend": {
      "root": "backend/",
      "entrypoint": "main:app",
      "headers": [
        {
          "source": "/(.*)",
          "has": [{ "type": "query", "key": "org", "value": "(?<org>.*)" }],
          "headers": [{ "key": "x-org-id", "value": ":org" }]
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/org/:orgSlug/api/:path*",
      "destination": {
        "service": "my_backend",
        "path": "/:path*?org=:orgSlug"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

For example, `GET /org/acme/api/users` routes to `my_backend` with the route lookup path `/users` and the query state `org=acme`. The service's own `headers` rule matches `org=acme` and adds `x-org-id: acme` to the response. Your service code still observes the original path `/org/acme/api/users`: the destination `path` only selects which route runs and the query state these rules match against, not the path your code sees. To change the path your service code observes, add a [`request.path` transform](/docs/project-configuration/vercel-json#request-path-transform-in-a-service) to the service's own `routes`.

## Internal calls between services

Top-level rewrites are public ingress. To let one service call another over the internal network, server-side and without a public route, use a [service binding](/docs/services/bindings) instead.
