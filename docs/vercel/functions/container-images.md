# Container Images

> **🔒 Permissions Required**: Container Images

Vercel Functions can run Open Container Initiative (OCI) compatible container images stored in [Vercel Container Registry (VCR)](/docs/container-registry). Functions scale up and down automatically based on demand, and use [Active CPU](/docs/functions/usage-and-pricing) pricing. You are only billed for CPU when your code is actively running, not while waiting for I/O or sleeping.

## Usage

### Dockerfile

Get started by creating a `Dockerfile.vercel` (or `Containerfile.vercel`) file placed at the root of your project. Vercel automatically detects these files and adds a rewrite rule to route all traffic to the container image:

#### \['Node.js and srvx dynamic server'

```docker filename="Dockerfile.vercel"
FROM node:26-alpine

RUN npm i -g srvx
WORKDIR /app
COPY server.ts .

# srvx listens on $PORT by default
CMD ["srvx", "--prod"]
```

```ts filename="server.ts"
export default {
  fetch(req: Request) {
    return Response.json({ ip: req.headers.get("x-forwarded-for") })
  }
}
```

#### 'Nginx static server']

```docker filename="Dockerfile.vercel"
FROM nginx:alpine

COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html
```

```html filename="index.html"
<h1>Hello from Vercel Functions running a custom OCI image!</h1>
```

Deploy your application using the [Vercel CLI](/docs/cli/deploy) or by pushing to a [Git repository](/docs/git). During the build step, the image will be built and pushed to [VCR](/docs/container-registry).

You can also develop and test locally using `vercel dev`. This requires the `docker` CLI and Docker daemon to be available on your machine.

### Services

You can use [services](/docs/services) to deploy multiple applications, backends or frontends, within the same Vercel project. Traffic is routed to the correct service with the `rewrites` configuration:

```json {5,9} filename="vercel.json"
{
  "services": {
    "frontend": {
      "root": "frontend/",
      "entrypoint": "Dockerfile.vercel"
    },
    "backend": {
      "root": "backend/",
      "entrypoint": "Dockerfile.vercel"
    }
  },
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/api/(.*)", "destination": { "service": "backend" } },
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": { "service": "frontend" } }
  ]
}
```

```docker filename="frontend/Dockerfile.vercel"
FROM nginx:alpine
...
```

```docker filename="backend/Dockerfile.vercel"
FROM node:26-alpine
...
```

Set the `entrypoint` key to the path of your dockerfile, relative to the service's `root`, for each service that uses a custom container image. See [services](/docs/services) for more information on configuring services.

## Observability

You can view [runtime logs](/docs/functions/logs) from the container's `stdout` and `stderr` streams. Because these logs are not tied to a specific request, they are broadcast to all inflight requests of the instance. [Vercel Observability](/docs/observability) metrics are available like any regular Vercel Function.

## Port resolution

Vercel Functions running container images are expected to open an HTTP server to receive traffic on. The default port is `80`, and it can be overridden by setting the `PORT` [environment variable](/docs/environment-variables) in the project settings.

## Scale in behavior

Functions not receiving any traffic for 5 minutes in production environments, and 30 seconds in preview environments, will automatically scale down.

When a function instance is scaled down, the container receives a `SIGTERM` signal with a 30 seconds grace period to clean up before being forcefully terminated. Learn more about the [`SIGTERM` signal](/docs/functions/functions-api-reference#sigterm-signal).

## Limits and pricing

The same [limits](/docs/functions/limitations) and [Active CPU pricing model](/docs/functions/usage-and-pricing) of Vercel Functions apply to custom container images.

[Secure Compute](/docs/networking/secure-compute) and [Static IPs](/docs/networking/static-ips) are not yet supported with custom container images.
