# Observability Plus

> **🔒 Permissions Required**: Observability Plus

Every Vercel team has access to [Observability](/docs/observability). **Observability Plus** is available on Paid Pro and Enterprise teams and unlocks more granular data exploration, helping you pinpoint when and why issues occurred.

For teams created or upgraded to Paid Pro on or after April 3, 2026, Observability Plus is enabled by default. Existing Paid Pro and Enterprise teams can [enable it separately](#enabling-observability-plus). Pro Trial plans require conversion to Paid Pro to access Observability Plus.

To learn more about Observability Plus, see [Limitations](#limitations) or [pricing](#pricing).

## Using Observability Plus

### Enabling Observability Plus

To enable Observability Plus on an existing Paid Pro or Enterprise team:

1. Go to the **Observability Plus** section of your team's [**Billing** settings](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fsettings%2Fbilling%23observability).
2. Turn on the **Observability Plus** toggle.
3. Review any charges, then confirm to enable.

> **💡 Note:** If you don't see Observability Plus in the upgrade flow or in Billing, contact [Vercel Support](/help) or your Vercel account representative for assistance.



#### Plan availability

Observability Plus access depends on your plan:

- **Paid Pro**: For teams created or upgraded to Paid Pro on or after April 3, 2026, Observability Plus is enabled by default. Existing Paid Pro teams can enable it using the steps above.
- **Hobby**: Upgrade to a Paid [Pro plan](/docs/plans/pro-plan) to access Observability Plus.

* **Pro Trial**: Observability Plus is not available during trial. Convert to a Paid Pro plan to access it.

- **Enterprise**: Enable Observability Plus using the steps above.

### Managing projects

By default, Observability Plus applies to all projects in your team. You can exclude specific projects to control costs. Excluded projects revert to the free-tier observability experience with limited retention and no access to advanced metrics or [Query](/docs/query).

#### Excluding a project

You can exclude a project from Observability Plus in three ways:

**During initial enablement:**

When [enabling Observability Plus](#enabling-observability-plus) for the first time, the setup flow includes a project selection step where you can choose which projects to exclude. This modal shows your top projects by usage. To exclude other projects, use the project-level option described below.

**From billing settings:**

1. Navigate to your team's [**Billing** settings](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fsettings%2Fbilling%23observability).
2. In the **Observability Plus** section, click **Manage projects**.
3. Toggle off the projects you want to exclude.

This modal also shows your top projects by usage. To exclude projects not listed in the modal, use the project-level option below.

**From the project observability dashboard:**

1. Navigate to your project's [**Observability** dashboard](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%5Bproject%5D%2Fobservability\&title=Go+to+Observability).
2. Click the more options button () at the top right of the page, then select **Exclude Project from Plus**.
3. Confirm the exclusion in the modal.

Events from excluded projects won't count toward your Observability Plus usage.

#### Including a project

To re-enable Observability Plus for an excluded project:

- **From billing settings**: Navigate to **Billing** > **Observability Plus** > **Manage projects** and toggle the project back on.
- **From the [project observability dashboard](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%5Bproject%5D%2Fobservability\&title=Go+to+Observability)**: Click the more options button () at the top right of the page, then select **Include Project in Plus**.

The project immediately regains access to Observability Plus features.

### Disabling Observability Plus

Paid Pro teams can disable Observability Plus at any time. After you disable it, Vercel stops collecting Observability Plus events. To regain access to extended retention data, re-enable it.

1. Go to the **Observability Plus** section of your team's [**Billing** settings](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fsettings%2Fbilling%23observability).
2. Click the toggle to disable it.
3. Click **Confirm** in the **Turn off Observability Plus** dialog.

## Pricing

Users on all plans can use Observability at no additional cost, with some [limitations](#limitations). Observability is available for all projects in the team.

Paid Pro and Enterprise teams can use **Observability Plus** for additional features, higher limits, and increased retention. Vercel bills you based on usage at a per-event rate. See the table below for pricing details:

| Resource | Usage-based pricing |
| --- | --- |
| Observability Plus | $1.20 per 1 million [events](/docs/observability#tracked-events) |

To access Observability Plus features, upgrade to a Paid [Pro plan](/docs/plans/pro-plan) or [enable Observability Plus](#enabling-observability-plus) on an existing Paid Pro or Enterprise team.

## Prorating

Observability Plus uses usage-based pricing. You're only charged for events your team generates. Usage is prorated within your billing cycle. For example:

- If you disable Observability Plus before the billing cycle ends, Observability Plus will automatically turn off, Vercel will stop collecting events, and you will lose access to existing data.
- Once the billing cycle is over, you will be charged for the events collected prior to disabling. You won't be refunded any amounts already paid.
